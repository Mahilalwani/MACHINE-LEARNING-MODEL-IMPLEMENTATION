*DESCRIPTION*:
In this project, I customized a little labeled sample dataset of spam and ham i.e. not spam for evaluation. Dictionary was used to store it. Then using various functions provided by different libraries, I drew some insights on it.
The libraries I installed were:
pandas and numpy for data handling, scikit-learn for model building and evaluation and matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.
The data was preprocessed using CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer. Then pipelined vectorization and classification.
Then trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes model on the data. Evaluated its performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix and classification report.
Performed cross-validation for reliabilty check.
As a result, The accuracy came as 0.7 that means 70% accurate. Because I provided a very small dataset of just 10 mails, the model couldn't see any patterns and thus it couldn't have very high accuracy still this accuracy is not bad!
Using larger data set can result in better accuracy.
Here's the confusion matrix
